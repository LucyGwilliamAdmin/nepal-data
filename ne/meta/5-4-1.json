Unpaid domestic and care work refers to activities related to the provision of services for own final use by household members, or by family members living in other households. These activities are listed in ICATUS 2016 under the major divisions \u201c3. Unpaid domestic services for household and family members\u201d and \u201c4. Unpaid caregiving services for household and family members\u201d.  \n\nConcepts:\nUnpaid domestic and care work refers to activities including food preparation, dishwashing, cleaning and upkeep of the dwelling, laundry, ironing, gardening, caring for pets, shopping, installation, servicing and repair of personal and household goods, childcare, and care of the sick, elderly or disabled household and family members, among others. These activities are listed in ICATUS 2016 under the major divisions \u201c3. Unpaid domestic services for household and family members\u201d and \u201c4. Unpaid caregiving services for household and family members\u201d.\n\nConcepts and definitions for this indicator are based on the following international standards:\n\uf0a7\tSystem of National Accounts 2008 (SNA 2008)\n\uf0a7\tThe Resolution concerning statistics of work, employment and labour underutilization, adopted by the International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) at its 19th Session in 2013\n\uf0a7\tInternational Classification of Activities for Time Use Statistics 2016 (ICATUS 2016)\n\nRelevant specific concepts are presented below:\n\uf0a7\tAn activity is said to be productive or to fall within the \u201cgeneral production boundary\u201d if it satisfies the third-person criterion (the activity can be delegated to another person and yield the same desired results).\n\uf0a7\tProductive activities can be further classified based on the ILO framework for work statistics (included in the 19th ICLS resolution) into:\na)\tOwn-use production work (activities to produce goods and services for own final use; the intended destination of the output is mainly for final use of the producer in the form of capital formation, or final consumption by household members or by family members living in other households; in the case of agricultural, fishing, hunting or gathering goods intended mainly for own consumption, a part or surplus may nevertheless be sold or bartered)\nb)\tEmployment (activities to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit)\nc)\tUnpaid trainee work (any unpaid activity to produce goods or provide services for others, in order to acquire workplace experience or skills in a trade or profession)\nd)\tVolunteer work (any unpaid, non-compulsory activity to produce goods or provide services for others)\ne)\tOther forms of work\nThe own-use production work can be differentiated based on whether goods or services are produced.\n\nIndicator 5.4.1 only considers the own-use production work of services, or in other words, the activities related to unpaid domestic services and unpaid caregiving services undertaken by households for their own use. These activities are listed in ICATUS 2016 under the major divisions \u201c3. Unpaid domestic services for household and family members\u201d and \u201c4.

With diaries, respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day, what activity followed, and the time that activity began and ended (in most of the cases based on fixed intervals), and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period, such as a day or a week. Often, stylized time-use questions are attached as a module to a multipurpose household survey. The 24-hour diary method yields better results than the stylized method but is a more expensive mode of data collection.","COLL_METHOD__GLOBAL":"Collection process:\nThe official counterparts at the country level are the national statistical offices.

Data on time-use can be collected through a 24-hour diary (light diary) or stylized questionnaire. With diaries, respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day, what activity followed, and the time that activity began and ended, and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period, such as a day or week. Often, stylized time-use questions are attached as a module to a multipurpose household survey. The 24-hour diary method yields better results than the stylized method but is a more expensive mode of data collection. Data obtained from these two different data collection methods are usually not comparable, and even data collected with different stylized questions might not be comparable given that the level of details asked about activities performed might differ from one instrument to another, thus impacting the total time spent on a given activity.  \nb)\tTime-use activity classification. Regional and national classifications of time-use activities may differ from ICATUS 2016, resulting in data that are not comparable across countries. \nc)\tTime-use data presented refer to the \u201cmain activity\u201d only. Any \u201csecondary activity\u201d performed simultaneously with the main activity is not reflected in the average times shown. For instance, a woman may be cooking and looking after a child simultaneously. For countries reporting cooking as the main activity, time spent caring for children is not accounted for and reflected in the statistics. This may affect international comparability of data on time spent caring for children; it may also underestimate the time women spend on this activity. \nd)\tDifferent target age population used by countries and age groups used also make time use data difficult to compare across countries.","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"Computation Method:\nData presented for this indicator are expressed as a proportion of time in a day. Weekly data is averaged over seven days of the week to obtain the daily average time. \n\nProportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work is calculated by dividing the daily average number of hours spent on unpaid domestic and care work by 24 hours. \n\nProportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work (Indicator 5.4.1) is calculated as:\n\nFormula 1\u2026(url)\nFormula 2\u2026(url)\n\nIf data on time spent are weekly, data are averaged over seven days of the week to obtain daily time spent.\n\nAverage number of hours spent on unpaid domestic and care work derives from time use statistics that is collected through stand-alone time-use surveys or a time-use module in multi-purpose household surveys. Data on time-use may be summarized and presented as either (1) average time spent for participants (in a given activity) only or (2) average time spent for all population of a certain age (total relevant population). In the former type of averages, the total time spent by the individuals who performed an activity is divided by the number of persons who performed it (participants). In the latter type of averages, the total time is divided by the total relevant population (or a sub-group thereof), regardless of whether people performed the activity or not. \n\nSDG indicator 5.4.1 is calculated based on the average number of hours spent on unpaid domestic and unpaid care work for the total relevant population. This type of measures can be used to compare groups and assess changes over time. Differences among groups or over time may be due to a difference (or change) in the proportion of those participating in the specific activity or a difference (or change) in the amount of time spent by participants, or both.
