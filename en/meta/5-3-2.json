The consultation process solicited feedback directly from National Statistical Offices, as well as other government agencies responsible for official statistics, on the compilation of the indicators, including the data sources used, and the application of internationally agreed definitions, classification and methodologies to the data from that source. Once reviewed, feedback is made available to countries on whether or not specific data points are accepted, and if not, the reasons why.

This review is based on a set of objective criteria to ensure that only the most recent and reliable information are included in the databases. These criteria include the following: data sources must include proper documentation; data values must be representative at the national population level; data are collected using an appropriate methodology (e.g., sampling); data values are based on a sufficiently large sample; data conform to the standard indicator definition including age group and concepts, to the extent possible; data are plausible based on trends and consistency with previously published/reported estimates for the indicator.</p>","COVERAGE__GLOBAL":"<p>Data availability:</p>\n<p>Nationally representative prevalence data are currently available for 30 low- and middle-income countries</p>\n<p>Time series:</p>\n<p>Disaggregation:</p>\n<p>Age, income, place of residence, geographic location, ethnicity, education</p>","COMPARABILITY__GLOBAL":"<p>Sources of discrepancies:</p>\n<p>The estimates compiled and presented at global level come directly from nationally produced data and are not adjusted or recalculated.</p>","OTHER_DOC__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>URL:</strong></p>\n<p>data.unicef.org</p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<p>https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-protection/female-genital-mutilation/</p>","indicator":"5.3.2","target_id":"5.3","sdg_goal":"5","indicator_sort_order":"05-03-02"}
