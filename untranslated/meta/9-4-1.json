When computed for the whole economy, it combines effects of the average carbon intensity of the energy mix (linked to the shares of the various fossil fuels in the total); of the structure of an economy (linked to the relative weight of more or less energy-intensive sectors); of the average efficiency in the use of energy. When computed for the manufacturing sector (CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fuel combustion per unit of manufacturing value added), it measures the carbon intensity of the manufacturing economic output, and its trends result from changes in the average carbon intensity of the energy mix used, the structure of the manufacturing sector, the energy efficiency of production technologies in each sub-sector and the economic value of the various output. Manufacturing industries are generally improving their emission intensity as countries move to higher levels of industrialization, but it should be noted that emission intensities can also be reduced through structural changes and product diversification in manufacturing. </p>\n<p>CO<sub>2</sub> emission accounts for around 80% of all GHG emission from the manufacturing processes. </p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Estimation of CO<sub>2</sub> emission data is not systematized in many countries, although is performed internationally based on harmonised energy data collected at national level. Energy data collection is generally well established, although in some cases national methodologies may differ from internationally agreed methodologies. National data sources include statistical offices, energy ministries, environment agencies, among others. Energy consumption data and value added data are coming from different data sources which may raise some consistency issues.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fuel combustion are estimated based on energy consumption and on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines on National GHG Inventories.</p>\n<p>The total intensity of the economy is defined as the ratio of total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fuel combustion and per unit of GDP. For international comparison purposes, GDP is measured in constant terms at purchasing power parity and the indicator is expressed in kilogrammes of CO2 per constant 2017 USD PPP for the current series.</p>\n<p>The sectoral intensity is defined as CO<sub>2</sub> emission from manufacturing (in physical measurement unit such as tonnes) divided by manufacturing value added (MVA) in constant

Considerable effort has been made to ensure that the data adhere to the IEA definitions based on the guidelines provided by IRES. Nevertheless, energy statistics at the national level are often collected using criteria and definitions which differ, sometimes considerably, from those of international organisations. This is especially true for non-OECD countries, which are submitting data to the IEA on a voluntary basis. The IEA has identified most of these differences and, where possible, adjusted the data to meet international definitions. For details on recognized country specific anomalies and the corresponding adjustments, please refer to country specific notes included in the IEA World energy balances documentation file available at: <a href=\"http://wds.iea.org/wds/pdf/WORLDBAL_Documentation.pdf\">wds.iea.org/wds/pdf/WORLDBAL_Documentation.pdf</a></p>\n<p>UNIDO compiles the MVA data based on the UNSD National Accounts Main Aggregates Database (NAMAD) and national publications.
