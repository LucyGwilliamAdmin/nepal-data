Almost all information regarding learning is school-based and does not take into account the completion of the level. The inclusion of completion in the global list offers to report according to completion status. he greatest differences between the SDG 4.1.1 on learning before completion and the disaggregation by completion are found in regions or countries with lower completion and enrollment rates because the adjusted (or children completing and learning) indicator is based on a quality-adjusted completion rate. This also explains why the largest differences occur at the lower-secondary level. Globally, 47% of lower-secondary students achieve minimum proficiency in reading according to the original SDG 4.1.1 Indicator, but the value for the adjusted indicator would fall to 34% of adolescents completing lower secondary and achieving minimum proficiency in mathematics.

The UIS and GAM establish standardization guidelines to guide the choice of the minimum thresholds based on the frameworks of each assessment program. The most critical decisions is to choose in each assessment a level for international reporting that is consistent with the international definition of MPL. In the case of some assessment program it means choosing a different level than the one the assessment program had been using for reporting results.</p>","IMPUTATION__GLOBAL":"<p>&#x2022; At country level</p>\n<p>Missing values are not imputed.</p>\n<p>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</p>\n<p>Missing values are not imputed.</p>","REG_AGG__GLOBAL":"<p>Not yet applicable.
