Not having access to this key assistance is detrimental to women&apos;s health because it could cause the death of the women or long lasting morbidity, especially in vulnerable settings. </p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The number of women aged 15-49 with a live birth attended by a skilled health personnel (e.g. doctors, nurses or midwives) during delivery is expressed as a percentage of women aged 15-49 with a live birth in the same period. </p>","IMPUTATION__GLOBAL":"<ul>\n  <li>At country level </li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is no treatment of missing values at country level.

Annual number of births from United Nations Population Division, World Population Prospects<sup>2</sup> is used is as a weighing indicator. Regional values are calculated for a reference year, including a range of 4-5 years for each reference year.

Values are reviewed and assess to make sure that reported indicator complies with standard definition and methodology. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As part of the country consultation, data are reported by UNICEF country office or statistical offices in country to UNICEF-HQ for global compilation. At the national levels, country offices are in touch with national authorities to compile and provide requested data, and therefore, values reported in global database are validated by national authorities. </p>","COVERAGE__GLOBAL":"<p>Data availability: </p>\n<p>Data are available for over 170 countries. </p>\n<p>The lag between the reference year and actual production of data series depends on the availability of the household survey for each country. </p>\n<p>Time series:</p>\n<p>1990-2019 </p>\n<p>Disaggregation: </p>\n<p>For this indicator, when data are reported from household surveys, disaggregation is available for various socio-economic characteristics including residence (urban/rural), household wealth (quintiles), education level of the mother, maternal age, geographic regions. When data are reported from administrative sources, disaggregation is more limited and tend to include only residence. </p>","COMPARABILITY__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong> </p>\n<p>Discrepancies are possible if there are national figures compiled at the health facility level. These would differ from the global figures, which are typically based on survey data collected at the household level. </p>\n<p>In terms of survey data, some survey reports may present a total percentage of births attended by a skilled health professional that does not conform to the SDG definition (e.g., total includes provider that is not considered skilled, such as a community health worker). In that case, the percentage delivered by a physician, nurse, or a midwife are totalled, consulted with the country and included in the global database as the SDG estimate. </p>\n<p>In some countries where the indicator on skilled attendant at birth is not actively reported, birth in a health facility (institutional births) is used as a proxy indicator. This is frequent countries in the Latin America region or in European and Central Asian regions, where the proportion of institutional births is very high. Nonetheless, it should be noted that institutional births may underestimate the percentage of births with skilled attendant. </p>","OTHER_DOC__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>URL: </strong><a href=\"https://data.unicef.org/topic/maternal-health/delivery-care/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><u>https://data.unicef.org/topic/maternal-health/delivery-care/#</u></strong></a><strong> </strong> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong> </p>\n<p>Joint UNICEF/WHO database 2020 of skilled health personnel, based on population-based national household survey data and routine health systems. </p>","indicator":"3.1.2","target_id":"3.1","sdg_goal":"3","indicator_sort_order":"03-01-02"}
